<p>This release..... <!-- JC to update general prose -->. </p>


<p>Some of the more noticeable changes in this release include:

<list>
  <item>The front page of the online Guidelines has been
  revised</item>
  <item><gi>docDate</gi> is now available as a child of <gi>dateLine</gi> (<ref
  target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/472/">https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/472/</ref>),
 and the content models of <gi>signed</gi> and <gi>salute</gi>   been loosened 
(<ptr
target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/433/"/>; <ptr
target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/478/"/>)
to allow more flexibility in the <q>top</q> <q>tail</q> of sections
  (prompted by experience in EEBO TCP)</item>
<item>poetry (<gi>l</gi>) is now allowed in the <gi>trailer</gi></item>
  <item>Usage of <att>corresp</att> has been clarified (<ref
  target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/506/">https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/506/</ref>).</item>
  <item>The value of the <att>matchPattern</att> attribute is now
  defined as W3C XPath syntax rather than W3C XML Schema Language
  (<ref
  target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/432/">https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/432/</ref>). This
  allows for more powerful regular expressions.</item>
  <item><att>perf</att> on <gi>tech</gi> now has the datatype 1+
  data.pointer, instead of data.enumerated (<ref
  target="http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/524/">http://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/524/</ref>).</item>
<item>support for <soCalled>pure ODD</soCalled>: it is now possible to define co tent models using TEI XML constructs only, as an alternative to the use of RELAXNG. This change is discussed further in a paper by Burnard and Rahtz presented at  <ref target="http://www.doceng2013.org/programme">this year's ACM Document Engineering conference</ref>. </item>
<item>use of the element <gi>valDesc</gi> throughout the TEI specifications code was rationalised: mostly this involved removal of redundant commentary, but in some cases element or attribute descriptions have been extended or modified.</item>
<item>a new <gi>abstract</gi> element has been added to support descriptive metadata about a "born-digital" item (such as a journal article in a review) to be stored in the TEI Header per <ptr
  target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/506/"/></item>
  

</list>
</p>

<p>There are also some changes to the way the Council is managing the
Guidelines:
<list>
  <item>Pre-release versions of the TEI P5 development tree are now
  tagged as "alpha" and "beta" in their version information.</item>
  <item>Preparatory to a program of getting translations of
  reference documentation up to date, all <gi>desc</gi> and
  <gi>gloss</gi> elements have been dated. This allows us to easily generate
  lists of translated blocks which are need revising.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>The XSL stylesheets which provide processing of TEI ODD files for
Roma and OxGarage have been updated, notably providing better support
for multi-namespace ODD</p>
