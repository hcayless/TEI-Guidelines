            <p>This version of the TEI Guidelines introduces new features and resolves a number of issues
                raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and
                corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI
                community using the SourceForge tracking system. If you find something you think
                needs to change in the TEI Guidelines, schemas, tools, or website, please submit a
                feature request or bug ticket at <ref target="http://tei.sf.net/"
                >http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for consideration. Lists of <ref

            <p>In addition, the XSL stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage
		as well as other TEI conversions) have been updated, notably providing better support for 
		multi-namespace ODD. The Stylesheets are being maintained separately from the 
		Guidelines and are at <ref
